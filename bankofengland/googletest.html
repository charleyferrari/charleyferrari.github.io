            <p>This graph shows a motion plot of two types of company visit scores. The demand score is on the x-axis and 
                Employment Score is on the Y-axis. The employment score is an average of the employment scores of the group of
                companies with a certain demand score. In other words, the raw data is filtered by the demand score. Then
                the average employment score of the filtered data set is calculated. The graph is animated by time, and the
                size of the circles correspond to the number of companies with the corresponding demand score.</p>
